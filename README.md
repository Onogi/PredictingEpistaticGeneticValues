# PredictingEpistaticGeneticValues
Python and R scripts used in Onogi A. 2019 "Predicting genotypic values associated with gene interactions using neural networks: A simulation study for investigating factors affecting prediction accuracy"

DNN3.py includes RunMLP, RetrieveMLP, and RetrieveWeights.
These functions are designed for simulated datasets included in Data.zip.

run.py and retrieve.py are examples to run RunMLP, RetrieveMLP, and RetrieveWeights.

Data.zip includes simulated datasets and R scripts used for the simulations.
