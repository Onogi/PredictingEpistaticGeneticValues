# PredictingEpistaticGeneticValues
Python and R scripts used in Onogi A. 2019 "Predicting genotypic values associated with gene interactions using neural networks: A simulation study for investigating factors affecting prediction accuracy".

DNN3.py includes RunMLP, RetrieveMLP, and RetrieveWeights.
These functions are designed for simulated datasets included in Data1-3.zip.

run.py and retrieve.py are examples to run RunMLP, RetrieveMLP, and RetrieveWeights.

Data1-3.zip include simulated datasets and R scripts used for the simulations.

RandomForest.R is the R script used for predition with random forests.
